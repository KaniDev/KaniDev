### Hello 🌍 !

I'm Jules, a developer from France.\
In my free time, I tinker with Linux, I build tech things DIY-style and I work on various personal projects.\
I also like skateboarding and I manage a local Super Smash Bros club.

Professionally, I'm mostly interested in UI/UX, deployment and sysadmin, but I'm open to discover other skillsets.
Here's a sample of my personal and academic projects...
 * 🌌 A custom Linux workflow on Arch, using [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3), [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) and [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
 * 📑 Quite a lot of [scripts](https://github.com/KaniDev/scripts) and [configs](https://github.com/KaniDev/configs)
 * 📱 A mobile Reddit Client written in Flutter
 * 📋 A modular Dashboard made with React and NodeJS
 * ⌨️ A hand-made keyboard using open-source [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware), edited in C
 * ⚡ A Raspberry Pi server for PiHole, Jellyfin, rtorrent, SSH and Wake on LAN using Docker
 * 🎮 A modded Nintendo Switch using [Hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate), [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere).
 * 🌲 A Minecraft Server / Discord bot integration using tmux and nodejs on an old repurposed macbook
